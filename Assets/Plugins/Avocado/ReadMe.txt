Dependencies Visualizer - Version 1.0.0
=======================================
Hot to use:
1. Open visualizer from the main menu: Tools -> Dependencies Visualizer -> Show
2. In main window you can add, delete, move nodes. Every node represent one assembly.
3. Configure layers in "Layers" window and setup layers for your nodes.

if some nodes depend on nodes from a higher layer, the editor will inform you about this.
